# MikroTik RouterOS Patch

### Description
This is a fork of [elseif/MikroTikPatch](https://github.com/elseif/MikroTikPatch). 

#### Features:
- Matching environment variables (except `CUSTOM_NPK_SIGN_*_KEY`) allow leveraging
  - the main repository author's replacement license portal for online licensing
  - the integrated binary keygen (x86 and arm64 only) for offline licensing
  - the Telegram bot keygens for mixed licensing
  - the main repository author's replacement cloud portal for dynamic DNS
- Ability to run locally [**WIP**]
- Wide architecture support [**WIP**]
- Extra software packages [**WIP**] 

#### Notes:
- This fork has a unique pair of `CUSTOM_NPK_SIGN_*_KEY` environment variables which prevents online upgrades from the main repository author's replacement upgrade portal. New packages could be downloaded but couldn't be installed due to non-matching signatures. Thus, only manually uploaded packages generated by this fork could be used for upgrades. [**WIP**]
- No licensing method listed above works for the original packages published by the vendor. No other forks could be licensed with them unless they have a matching pair of `CUSTOM_LICENSE_*_KEY` environment variables.
