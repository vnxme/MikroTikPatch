# MikroTik RouterOS Patch

### Description
This is a fork of [elseif/MikroTikPatch](https://github.com/elseif/MikroTikPatch). 

#### Features:
- Matching environment variables (except `CUSTOM_NPK_SIGN_*_KEY`) allow leveraging
  - the main repository author's replacement license portal for online licensing
  - the integrated binary keygen (x86 and arm64 only) for offline licensing
  - the Telegram bot keygens for mixed licensing
  - the main repository author's replacement cloud portal for dynamic DNS
- Ability to run locally [**WIP**]
- Wide architecture support [**WIP**]
- Extra software packages [**WIP**] 

#### Notes:
- This fork has a unique pair of `CUSTOM_NPK_SIGN_*_KEY` environment variables which prevents online upgrades from the main repository author's replacement upgrade portal. New packages could be downloaded but couldn't be installed due to non-matching signatures. Thus, only manually uploaded packages generated by this fork could be used for upgrades. [**WIP**]
- No licensing method listed above works for the original packages published by the vendor. Neither other forks could be licensed with them (except for the universal keygen, see below) unless they have a matching pair of `CUSTOM_LICENSE_*_KEY` environment variables.
